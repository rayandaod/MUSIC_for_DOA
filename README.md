# SSDP mini-project: MUSIC for DOA

## Summary

MUSIC for DOA is a popular algorithm used to obtain the Direction Of Arrival estimation for different signals reaching sensor arrays. In ths project, we were asked to implement the BASIC algorithm and an IMPROVED version, and apply it on GENERATED data and REAL data.
As references, we were given the project of [Huang Guyue, Iriarte Sainz Diego Gabriel and Nyambuu Lkham](https://github.com/rayandaod/SSDP_mini-project/tree/master/DOA_final).

## Organisation

The project is divided in 3 jupyter notebooks:
- MUSIC for DOA on generated data, containing both basic and improved algorithm.
- MUSIC for DOA on real data, also containing an adapted version for both basic and improved algorithm.
- Various Simulations, tests and examples.

## Dependencies

```bash
jupyter
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
json
math
datetime
ipython 
```
